2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers   This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:  Exhibit 1 PepsiCo:   >In the U S   lower income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks  Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company\u2019s conference call  Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers  particularly for its snacks like Cheetos \ud83e\udd22      Exhibit 2 Walmart:      >The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well  so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well  We took our French bread \ud83e\udd56 back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market  And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year  so customers immediately responded  Rotisserie chicken \ud83c\udf57 is another one  That price has come down by $1  Customers are responding      It's becoming clear that Ameri Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day \ud83e\udd2cThis is a bad situation for u\/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal    If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months    If Ameri Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs  Cheetos  and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously     Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years    MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit    Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers  if aggressive pricing is on the table then

ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL  Is anyone bullish about $CCL    Honestly  take a look at the fundamentals  the bottom and top lines  and consider its potential for growth   (Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = \ud83d\ude80 potential   Loyal customer base  solid balance sheet  and a fleet of 100+ ships   Long term play  potential 5x 10x return )  I'm bullish about $CCL  and here's why:  First  let's take a look at the fundamentals  Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company  with a market cap of approximately $18 79 billion as of April 24  2024  The company has a solid balance sheet  with a debt to equity ratio of 0 78  indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity  Additionally  $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships  making it a major player in the cruise industry   Now  let's consider the company's financial performance  In 2023  $CCL reported revenue of $24 5 billion  a significant increase from the $5 6 billion it reported in 2022  This indicates that the travel demand is surging  and $CCL is well positioned to benefit from this trend   Moreover  $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued  with a price to earnings (P\/E) ratio of 10 4  compared to the industry average of 15  This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth   The company's history also supports a bullish outlook  Before the pandemic  $CCL was a high flying stock  with a P\/E ratio of over 20  While the pandemic had a significant impact

few weeks) I believe we're going to get some juicy fireworks a la Guy Fawkes soon  Here's my reasoning:  While the world celebrates that Iran and Israel have calmed down  we must remember war strategy  the art of war  and how real war games work  If you wish to have a successful offence: A) the element of surprise is key  B) never reveal dates or timing of an attack  Iran will not announce a real counter attack and will play this down as much as possible  IDF has since  remobilised troops to Rafah  leaving the North vulnerable  Iran clearly stated that a counter attack by Israel will not go unanswered and we know that \"the best future defence is a good offence\"  Iran will launch a massive attack soon  either by proxy or together with their proxies and when this happens  bulls will be

Tesla bears do not see (humanoid robots  PMI) I have been a Tesla bear for a long time and have not invested in them until very recently  I only bought \\~30 shares (DCA from 160 to 140  with average price \\~150) because I was waiting for it to get to $120  but I guess if everyone wants it at $120 it won\u2019t go to that price  Anyways  a lot of people seem to be upset that Tesla did not nosedive after the well expected horrible earnings but Tesla can be very good stock at current price for two reasons   1  I believe humanoid robots will be one of the most important technology of this decade and Tesla is at the forefront  Tesla is the only company (other than Hyundai probably) that has mass production experience and technology to make humanoid robots  Good engineers still prefer to work at Tesla than other manufacturing companies  For example  last time I checked around 2023  most of the PhD students from top robotics lab at UCLA went on to work at Tesla  The AI development for robots will probably be easier than robotaxi because there is much larger margin of error (not moving at 100mph  mostly controlled environment)  If they announce something like \u201ccommercial robots at factories 202X and at homes 202(X+P) for $Y0 000 \u201d the stock price can go $300s  2  Tesla is considered to be very interest rate sensitive  There was a lot of fear that US inflation just will not come down (some even suggesting that the Fed will raise rates)  But PMI result that came out yesterday morning was much better for inflation than expected  Tesla stock can pop with rate cut      I agree with bears (and have been Tesla bear) that much of the stock price already priced in Tesla\u2019s dreams  However  even if none of their dreams come true  Tesla will probably be $120 around 2026 where as the upside is massive   P S  With that said  I have following bearish points just to summarize my thoughts   1  EV is inferior product for consumer experience compared to ICE for most people unless autonomous driving or solid state battery become available  People make analogy of ICE to EV to 2G to smartphone but I wonder if these people actually have ever been on road trips with EV  2  Robotaxi with vision only might never happen  The AI issue of robotaxi is very different from generative AI as generative AI is almost expected to be wrong much of the times whereas robotaxi cannot be wrong ever  It is a tail end  rare event problem  People assume that Tesla will be the only one to solve robotaxi because they have more data than others  but I can make petabytes of data by copy

open on using FSD  female riders are exactly opposite of this  (tsla marketing team should take note on this) * Robotaxi would probably go through stages    * the first stage would be something I am

Thoughts on $CLS Celestica Earnings on 4\/24\/2024  I hold stock and debating whether to pick up a call or two  Here are some bullish thoughts from my broker's research department:  Bottom Line:  We remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1\/24 results\u2014as we believe that CLS will continue to benefit  both in the near term and longer term  from the large AI driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers  We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity  nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative   Key Points We anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise  Consensus Q1\/24 estimates call for revenue of $2 1b and adj  EPS of $0 72  while FY2024 consensus is at $8 78b for revenue and $2 93 for adj  EPS  Current FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of >$8 5b and adj  EPS of $2 70; however we believe it's clear that this is too conservative\u2014given subsequent capex guidance from key customers  which suggests that demand is accelerating  Our expectation is that FY2024 guidance will be raised to a level that's similar to  although perhaps not above  current consensus   We're unclear on where buyside consensus might stand  but in our view  the stock's current valuation and significant pullback from its recent peak suggest that a sizable beat isn't currently being priced in   Proprietary silicon servers  and 800G  should drive ongoing share gains  We believe that CLS has stronger competitive differentiation with respect to AI servers that are based on proprietary silicon vs  NVIDIA  Large hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft appear likely to shift a growing proportion of their server spend towards the former vs  the latter  and we expect that CLS should benefit from this dynamic  Additionally  CLS has been awarded 800G design wins from some of its hyperscaler customers  which are slated to ramp later this year and into FY2025   While competition is a key risk (particularly given CLS's customer concentration)  we believe that this is mitigated by the aforementioned factors  and the fact that Street estimates are only assuming single digit revenue growth in FY2025 despite strong demand tailwinds  Further  the Street isn't forecasting much in the way of margin expansion next year  and we believe this may also represent a source of incremental upside   We've raised our target price to US$48  reflecting 15x CY2025E adj  P\/E and 8 8x EV\/EBITDA   Our Thesis We rate Celestica shares Outperform  We believe the stock's historical valuation discount to peers should continue to narrow given its revenue and margin trajectory  the significant improvements that CLS has made to its revenue mix in recent years  and its AI exposure   Valuation Our US$48 target price is based on a CY2025E adj  P\/E multiple of 15x and EV\/EBITDA multiple of 8 8x  We believe this is appropriate in the context of CLS's peer group given its relative size  growth profile and revenue mix   Upside Scenario $55 00 Our upside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate increases by 7%  perhaps driven by a stronger recovery in semi equipment and better than expected hyperscaler demand  and the stock's multiple expands to 16x adj  P\/E   Downside Scenario $34 00 Our downside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate decreases by 7%  perhaps due to a softer demand backdrop  and the stock's multiple contracts to 11 5x adj

past  and in particular  blood cancers   It\u2019s not a new treatment  but now it\u2019s being used to treat indications that are not cancer     Cells from the patient are taken in a blood draw   They are then mixed with a virus that easily infects human cells   The virus itself does not carry any genetic information of the virus; it carries the genetic information on how to identify and kill a B cell   The \u201cinfected\u201d cells that now carry the \u201ccorrect\u201d genetic targeting information are then put into a media where they can grow   Once they reach an optimal population  they are put back into the patient   These \u201cCAR T\u201d cells then kill off the problematic B cells in the patient\u2019s body for a prolonged period of time  and then the patient\u2019s B cells repopulate months\/years down the road without them engaging in an autoimmune response (attacking\/killing the good cells)     Without sounding like a big salesman for the company (I have no affiliation with the company)  there have been striking results published in the New England Journal of Medicine   It\u2019s important to note that this Journal has a very high standard of publishing quality data   They have shown that the \u201cconstruct\u201d (genetic bits that go into the CAR T cell) will effectively kill off the autoimmune related B cells that are hurting the patient  and that there will be a \u201cdurable\u201d effect on the patient (+2 years)   The technology was born out of U Penn and Oxford and they are partnered with WuXi to scale their initial products    The stock:

float)  but nothing too crazy going on   The analysts SP forecast range is from $25   $50   Their corporate slide deck says that they will have their first clinical readouts for both Lupus and Myositis during the first half of this year and we\u2019re nearly late April right now   They will have a second readout during the second half   Seeing that the stock has a relatively low float for a non commercialized biotech  any good news would propel the SP  and based on the published data so far  it seems like a probable positive outcome  but yeah  Science is tricky sometimes   I have a handful of near the money July calls  but I do believe that it would jack up above $20 on good data   I may buy a few far out of the money calls in July too if the data haven\u2019t been released in

materialized (first negative quarter) 5  Decrease in operating margins (read point 6) 6  Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from  Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response) 7  Robo taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem 8  Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough  the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation 9  Lay offs  talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming  special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth 10  Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i e  democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states 11  Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over priced a few earnings ago 12  Ceo is not full time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars 13  China is bank rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD  Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory) 14  Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer 15  No single product that could yield out sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization 16  Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift 17  At the end of the day  no car marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique 18  Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1\/6 or 1\/8th the price 19  Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe dream 20  Cash balance controlling for short term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues  the existing slight above junk credit rating will worsen 21  They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny  they don't talk about that much anymore 22  Just laid off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected 23  Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford\/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla 24  Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned

has been a crash for NVDA  but there's no need to panic  Market cap erased by 10% in a single day  I decided to escape from the top after NVDA plunged below 823  a key support level  Therefore  I cleared all my holdings of NVDA and NVDL at a price of around 810 820  Aside from that  I profited 30% from intraday shorting  by buying and selling 790 put  which compensated for about 60% of my loss incurred during the escpae   680 740 is an ultrastrong support level for NVDA  The 1 yr forward PE of NVDA has fallen to 31  a comfortable level  If the price can further plunge by 5% 10%  the forward PE value will be a typical level for mega caps in the tech sector  which is small for NVDA (we need to consider its growth potential)   The earnings call may be a tipping point for NVDA  but it is still 1 month away  I expect that NVDA to be consolidating between 680 and 740 before that  the gap never filled after its blockbusting 2023 annual earnings   Here is my plan:  1  40% for left entry  Have bought 10% of 9\/20 1000 call when the price fell to 760  Expect to buy another 10% when the price falls to 720 740  and another 20% when the price falls to 680 700  2  40% for right entry  If the price starts to go up before the earnings  buy 20% at the tipping point  and another 20% when the 9 day EMA crosses the 26 day EMA from the below  a key indicator of buying  3  If the price of NVDA drops below 680  clear all long positions and use 50% for short selling  namely  put option @ 700  This will continue at all rebounds until NVDA falls to 500  the price last December   Update: Change of Plan   After rethinking what happened to NFLX  I have decided to clear all long positions and wait until the market stabilizes itself  or a new trend emerges  There exists a strong probability that 'selling at the news' will occur  Even if META  MSFT  GOOGL all report blockbusting earnings  beating expectations in both guidelines and quarterly results  the stock prices may still dip  let alone something goes wrong with their earnings  like what happened to GOOGL earlier this year  AMZN dipped 3%  while META plunged 4%  all because of NVDA today  Similar things will happen if one of the mega caps delivers worse than expectation earnings   The new plan:  1  Close all long positions on Monday to avoid risks  If there is a rebound on Monday and Tuesday  buy a very small short position (\\~2%) by putting NVDA  2  If something happens during the earnings  put NVDA and buy SQQQ  If the earnings are all good  wait until all indices stabilize before buying long positions

We Approaching the Breaking Point for Stock Valuations and Interest Rates  Stocks have been on a tear since last October  with valuations (price to earnings ratios) soaring from around 20x to 25x (the blue line in the chart)  This surge in stock valuations coincided with a sharp drop in interest rates  with the 10 year Treasury yield plunging from 5% to below 4% in just a few months (the white line  using the inverted scale on the right)   It makes sense that lower rates would boost valuations  as they increase the present value of future earnings  However  here's where things get interesting: even as rates started climbing again earlier this year  valuations continued to creep higher instead of reversing course as you might expect   So what gives  Well  the economy has shown surprising resilience despite the higher rate environment  This has allowed investors to focus on positive factors like the strength of the US consumer and the potential for AI driven earnings growth  essentially shrugging off the headwinds from elevated interest rates   But this disconnect between rates and valuations might not last forever  Morgan Stanley warns that there's a breaking point around the 4 35% level on the 10 year Treasury yield  where higher rates could really start to weigh on valuations and stock prices  Lo and behold  we just crossed that threshold  If rates continue to march higher  investors may start to factor this into their valuation models  bringing those lofty multiples back down to earth    This could spell trouble not just for riskier  rate sensitive segments of the market like small caps and value stocks (which tend to have higher financing costs and more leveraged balance sheets)  but also for the market leaders if they fail to deliver on ambitious earnings expectations   As we head into the thick of earnings season  it's crucial to monitor not just the headline results and management commentary  but also the trajectory of interest rates in the background  The stock market has been able to defy gravity in the face of rising rates so far   but that might not be the case for much longer  Don't be caught off guard if this crucial

Thesis   No Deal and No Merger Outlook This thesis builds on continued earnings growth from Q3 and Q4 of 2023  I am anticipating EPS of between $0 75 and $1 00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024  I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x\/14x PE on that basis    If we take away any deal aspect  Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors  I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x  while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x  Given market conditions  I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line  a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025   I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B  I\u2019m fairly confident the Skydance deal won\u2019t be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal  I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this   Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B   Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so     Overall  bullish on Paramount  I think it\u2019s trading in undervalued territory  Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates  Do with this what you will    Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects  David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone  He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and\/or all voting shareholders  He\u2019s also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised  but in my opinion  if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues  would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings)    Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal  Between the two  the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share    Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025  Overall  I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense  It\u2019s a dramatic story if you

success   Plus  many users don\u2019t pay for the premium subscriptions   However  this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up   The avg analyst estimate for next year\u2019s earnings is $ 93   Add a 21X multiple  which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%   You get $19 53   Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18 25    Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12 77    I\u2019m a buyer at any price below $12 77     I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this company became an acquisition target   Amongst my friends  everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps   At a $1 8B market cap  I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble   They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company\u2019s main expense (advertising)    EA Current Price $126 Target Price $148 Avg analyst estimate is $7 58 EPS next year   With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%  you get $148   Plus the new EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy   I\u2019ve been waiting 11 years for this game  But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process   I also love TTWO stock for the same reason     RIVN Current price $8 92 Target Price: $9 58+ This stock is now trading below it\u2019s cash value of $9 58 per share   The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap   The EV market is in trouble short term  but still has huge long term upside  Rivian sells it\u2019s trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them   Never good   Although Tesla once had the same problem   At a $8 6B market cap  this company is worth a flyer   Don\u2019t make it more than 1% of your portfolio  but I think it\u2019s worth a flyer at these depressed prices   Amazon already has a 16 6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order  so don\u2019t be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8 6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don\u2019t short this stock)     TSLA Current price $150 6 Target Price $294 Honestly I\u2019m ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I\u2019ve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices   If you sell a stock because it's going down  you're not an investor   You're a moron   The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low cost car to the robotaxi   In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who\u2019s smarter than any of us) this is the right move   The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off   Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one  The real money is in the future with robotaxis   The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible  My friend\u2019s Tesla drives him all around Cleveland  He never has to take over the wheel   The regulatory issues will probably be a problem  Especially if Biden is re elected  The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be   But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis   I think in 5 years  you\u2019ll have Tesla robotaxis   You\u2019ll open your Tesla app  order a ride  and it\u2019ll pick you up  Tesla makes a car for $20K  That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself)  That car could easily generate $50K annually  That\u2019s a 2 5X annual return for every car they manufacture  They made 1 85M cars in 2023  Up 38% YOY  If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%)  that's 7 5M cars in 10 years  Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year  That's $375M+ in revenue  It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue  That's at least a $1 875T Market Cap  Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that\u2019s 1 34T market cap  or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting)   Add a 30% margin of safety  and I\u2019m buying this stock any price below $294        MCD  SBUX Honestly  both these companies are probably close to fairly priced  trading around 21X next year\u2019s earnings   But in a market where most stocks are overpriced  these two stand out   And I\u2019m willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years   Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing  they will at least increase with monetary inflation   But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally   I live in Peru  and both McDonald\u2019s and Starbux are extremely popular with the

Halving and the Brewing Storm in Crypto Mining: A Deep Dive As most of you know  the Bitcoin halving is due in just a few days  This event  which occurs roughly every four years  is a built in feature of Bitcoin that reduces the reward for mining new blocks in half  Currently  miners are rewarded 900 BTC per day  but post halving  this will drop to 450 BTC  With Bitcoin's current valuation  this reward reduction could slash the industry's annual revenue by an estimated $10 billion  That's huge   Previous halvings have historically led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin  which helped mitigate the reduced mining rewards  However  this time the context is different  and here\u2019s why:  1  Increased Operational Costs: The mining difficulty has shot up nearly six times since the last halving  driven by a surge in the miner population chasing the same reward pie  Consequently  to stay competitive  miners are forced to invest in more expensive equipment  which is a hefty financial commitment   2  Energy Cost Competition: Miners are also vying against deep pocketed Big Tech firms for affordable electricity  These firms are investing heavily in AI and data centers  and utility companies prefer them over crypto miners for their stable financial outlook  leaving miners with higher electricity costs   Now  here's the kicker  The increased skepticism around the profitability of crypto mining has led traders to place significant short bets against crypto mining stocks  Last I checked  the total short interest for a group of 15 crypto mining stocks is hovering around $2 billion  representing almost 15% of these companies' available shares  To put that into perspective  it's three times the US market average short interest   The market seems to be signaling a lack of confidence in the mining industry's ability to cope with the halving and rising operational costs  We're looking at a potential violent move up or a downturn in mining stocks  depending on

whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies Hello everyone  I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing   One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [\"John Barnett found dead in US\"](https:\/\/   and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:  *\"In 2019  Mr Barnett told the BBC that under pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub standard parts to aircraft on the production line  He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems  which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency  He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised  something the company denied \"*  He also felt he was in danger  and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon    Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https:\/\/ and this is what he said:  \t*\"A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer \u201cabsolutely\u201d has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns *  *Sam Salehpour  a quality engineer at the company  said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes  Separately  he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre *  *\u201cI have raised these issues over three years \u201d he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing\u2019s safety culture  \u201cI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told  frankly  to shut up \u201d*  Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously  as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide   **TESLA'S whistleblower**  On a smaller scale  I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower  much more known in Europe than in the USA  The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt  and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article \"[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https:\/\/   The guy  L  Krupski  used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location  and Elon Musk thanked him in person   Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him  and before leaving the company  L  discovered that from his work computer  he could have access to all the data of the company  including financials  product defections  and personal information of both employees and customers  He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https:\/\/ Later on  also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset   Overall  the information can be divided in 4 sections:  * Privacy data breach * Cybertruck details and problems * Product defects (faulty suspensions  autopilot\/fsd problems  phantom braking etc ) * Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud  **Privacy** Initially  Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue  The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines  that is around $3 5 billion  See [Reuters article](https:\/\/   Meta was once fined for a similar data breach  Most notably  Handelsblatt cross checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla  listed in the files   **Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck  publishing an article \"[\"A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws\"](https:\/\/   In the article  it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare  The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed  at the launch  the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago  and 50% less of the promised performance  Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out  are malfunctioning at astounding rate\"](https:\/\/nypost com\/2024\/04\/08\/business\/teslas cybertrucks were rushed out are malfunctioning at astounding rate\/)  **Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset  as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years  It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections  so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued  Also  Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD  with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market  Handelsblatt published again an article in December  with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: \"[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors\"](https:\/\/ with employees saying:  *Erik Larsen\\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla  He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn  After five unwanted braking events in just one week  Larsen was also skeptical: \u201cI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking \u201d*  *None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents  It remained just speculation  \u201cI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it \u201d thought service technician Borja Clausen\\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks  Engineer Jesper Thomassen\\* wrote: \u201cI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often  but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places \u201d*  Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions  mostly about the MX & MS lineups  but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions  Most notably  Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China  but it did not do anything in the West  Here is the article: [\"Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective\"](https:\/\/   Again  Musk refused to comment on this  If you read the article  the reports are indeed alarming:  *\"Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts \u2013 the left and right drive axles \u2013 and steering racks  which often needed replacing after sudden power steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents  One driver said in an interview that his brand new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power steering suddenly failed at speed  nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch *  *At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension  steering or wheel assembly  company records show  Those accident claims  which have not been previously reported by the media  were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review \"*  A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https:\/\/carup se\/larmade om farligt fel fredriks film stoppad av teslas advokater\/](https:\/\/carup se\/larmade om farligt fel fredriks film stoppad av teslas advokater\/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016  but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https:\/\/dailykanban com\/2016\/06\/08\/tesla suspension breakage not crime coverup\/](https:\/\/dailykanban com\/2016\/06\/08\/tesla suspension breakage not crime coverup\/)  **Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021  but the agency never interviewed them  Here's what the complaint said](https:\/\/  * about warranty repairs: From what is reported  it seems that Tesla increased its short term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs  According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack)  Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS  despite its many defections  Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs  Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs  and the customer bill is billed as revenue  *\u201cWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters \u201d she said  \u201cIf I\u2019m taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales  and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement  that will make my gross profit margin look higher  If I\u2019m moving it from up above in cost of sales  and moving into other expenses  it\u2019s also not as transparent about the quality of the product \u201d* * accountancy of new car sales: \"*In another example  the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of \u201cused\u201d cars to \u201cnew\u201d in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data  This could affect Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers  they said  though they didn\u2019t try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further  \"*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new  just to make the delivery report look better\" * inventories value assessment: \"*In one example  the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from \u201cscrap\u201d to \u201cwork in progress \u201d Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste \"* Again  in order to increase profitability  scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work in progress parts  just to avoid decreasing short term margins  [Back in 2019](https:\/\/twitter com\/BradMunchen\/status\/1306909890586107904)  some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent    It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings  and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings   **CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him  as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet  after the first articles  nobody ever mentioned it    Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset  that's why Tesla never sued them  but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https:\/\/ It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones  and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information   Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones

on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here   This is my first DD so please be gentle\ud83d\ude0a  The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04\/12:  [https:\/\/  Quote: \"The FDA received more than 3 800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year  The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12 300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7 700 for Solensia since 2021  when the drugs went on sale in Europe  The figures include reports from the U S  and other countries outside of the European Union \"  But a 04\/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: \"Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and\/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products  On recent concerns over Librela side effects \u00a0*only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela  83% have some level of concern but still prescribe  and 13% are not at all concerned *\u00a0\"  Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings   Critically  Librela & Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most   Also per Morgan Stanley:  * \"we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0 73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1 01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)\"    on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7 8%  pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already   This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys  * \"the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption  but for analysis purposes)  would be 27 6x FY25 at the current share price  still below its 10 year historical average of 29 2x  suggesting the stock may be overly punished \"  Lastly  let's look at the technical side  ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart  If it continues

RDDT is going to surprise on earnings in 4 charts I have a history of making niche websites and it was my main source of income up until about a year ago when I made a bit of a pivot   Since then Google has released a couple of updates and it's absolutely annihilated most of my niche content     This has been bad for me  but great for large content producers like Reddit  Medium  Quora  etc who have all seen their organic traffic absolutely skyrocket in the past 6 months   Google's Helpful Content Update (HCU) has pushed out a lot of frankly pretty bad websites like mine in favor of content that is verified by other users or from a larger site   To give you a bit of an idea of the scale of this  here is a graph showing the assumed traffic to [Reddit com](https:\/\/Reddit com) from SEMrush   This isn't exact and Reddit would have better numbers  but it showcases the absolutely stratospheric amount of traffic that Reddit is getting over the past 6 months   &#x200B;  https:\/\/preview redd it\/y87yiv0wi4vc1 jpg width=887&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25a831855089be16e1530816cb8b279d5c7f366e  Now here is Reddit's traffic from their own S 1 form over the past couple of years   Note that the number of app users in Red increases slowly  but the number of non logged in users increases and decreases in correlation with the SemRUSH graph   That last little dip before it rockets to the moon is June 2023 which correlates with the logged out drop in Q2 2023 (29 2 million to 28 3 million)     &#x200B;  https:\/\/preview redd it\/tvjkdp0aj4vc1 jpg width=689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ef51808ae2885cd467ef424c8ec08cbd60af93c  You can see that by **FAR** the largest increase is in Q4 2023 which is only halfway up that SEMrush crayon line   Reddit should easily see 40 million non logged in daily users in Q1 if the trend continues   These users all have a chance to convert into degenerates like you and me  but it doesn't really matter because that Daily Average Unique User is going to look sexy AF to investors when RDDT drops it's next earnings   # But really it doesn't matter how many people log in or view the website because Reddit has never made money and can't monetize it's users   Well  you're wrong about that too   RDDT is on a path to monetize it's user base and has made a bunch of strides in the right direction in terms of advertising   Anecdotally the quality of ads I've been receiving has been a lot better in the past year    # BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER  Advertising is a marketplace and just like the stock market it goes up and down over the course of a year   Reddit's advertising is much more tied to the intrinsic cost of advertising than it is anything they are doing internally   They even mention it in their S 1 \" We experience seasonality in our business and financial results  Overall advertising spend tends to be highest in the fourth quarter of each year due in large part to end of year advertiser spending and lowest in the first quarter of each year  In addition  we believe our strong growth in prior periods has made it difficult to evaluate the impact of seasonality on our business  and we expect seasonality to become more pronounced in the future as our business matures  \"  To draw this out in a format you're used to you can check out this chart from Ezoic  I really dislike the company  but I do love their Ad Revenue Index which showcases your expected earnings showing display ads on a website   This chart is a bit funky to read  but essentially it takes the highest mark on the day where you would expect to earn the most and then relates every other day to that     So as someone with a niche site  the best day for expected revenue was in November of 2021   This was towards the end of Covid when the market was gearing back up  money was free  and Christmas was just around the corner   That's why Q4 (November especially) is always the best for advertising companies (Christmas)  and then it absolutely shits the bed in the New Year   This happens EVERY year  except for this one   &#x200B;  https:\/\/preview redd it\/q4o0d1tzl4vc1 jpg width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95981bd9688da43c2b063010dad77086e8ec0ac5  You can play around with it here   [https:\/\/nicheindex ezoic com\/report#niche](https:\/\/nicheindex ezoic com\/report#niche)  This year  there was the expected Christmas boom and then New Year hangover  but ad revenue is actually at the same or higher level than it was in November of last year   This is unheard of and absolutely not the norm  but it relates to Christmas being a bit poor for advertising revenue this year while Q1 has actually been a bit strong for advertisers   Now how does this relate to RDDT   Well let's take a look  RDDT's revenue has been rising every year but it's Revenue is directly tied to the expected ad revenue   If we pull their Quarterly Results of Operations data from their S 1 and take a look at 2021   &#x200B;  https:\/\/preview redd it\/5xnmh7crm4vc1 jpg width=1255&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b97e1f962c1e39c8ba3f9b71354cf31c9e1e869e  In 2021 RDDT's revenue was 79 million for Q1  108 million for Q2  121 million for Q3  and 177 million for Q4   This directly correlates with the ad revenue index where we would expect ad revenue to be roughly double (\\~40th percentile to the \\~80th percentile)   Then immediately into Q1 of the following year revenue drops from 177 million to 146 million which matches what we  see when comparing the chart   Now what's interesting about this is that in 2024 we don't see that expected ad revenue drop in our ad revenue chart  in fact Q1 of 2024 might actually have a higher expected ad revenue than Q4 of 2023 especially in February and March   So what happens when the Daily Average Unique users jumps up because Google has skyrocketed the organic users AND advertising revenue is higher AND you've improved your advertising platform   Rocket meet moon   RDDT is going to post a similar or larger revenue number to Q4 of last year showcasing 50+% revenue growth year over year and it's second profitable quarter in a row  Last Q1 they posted a revenue of 163 million  this Q1 I expect it to be right around the 250 mark and with revenue growing at three times the pace of costs this earnings report will

faster and more streamlined implementation for customers  These initiatives have allowed some clients to emerge from the bootcamps with functional  value adding products  addressing the deployment

\u2022\tFebruary: 105 new customers  \u2022\tMarch: 147 new customers  This showed an increasing trend in customer acquisition as the quarter progressed  To forecast the number of new customers for Q2

Tesla preparing a capital raise  Production cuts  massive layoffs    and the Robotaxi narrative Hello everyone   I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day  The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business  although the cash position looks strong  these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:  &#x200B;  * FCF is now negative  as in Q1 2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k  46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn  unprecedented for the company  You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https:\/\/tesla info com\/blog\/inventory stats regional\/Global q=4) As you can see from this chart  inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever present inventory discounts (in the USA) * Companies that need to save cash  often cut production  fire white collar employees  and try to maximize their income  Tesla did all of these three things  as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories)  If you plan to raise capital  the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes  Tesla has a big overproduction problem) * even if they might not build any new giga factory  despite their steady news flow on the topic last year  the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain  As everybody knows  $NVDA GPUs are super expensive * Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic  not the ugly X one  car sales do not matter  only FSD & Robotaxi do  the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport * the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street  Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts  The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [\"Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia\"](https:\/\/   Well  as you will see below  many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned  and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi  Moreover  MS is very silent in the last week  even if they used to update investors daily  Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week  * Still  it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year  despite its huge cash position  The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy  that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard  &#x200B;  **Business is failing in China  FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**  In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market  Xiaomi  BYD  and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https:\/\/twitter com\/EdwardDiGi\/status\/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https:\/\/electrek co\/2024\/04\/15\/tesla puts electric car codenamed nv9 back burner despite elon musk said\/)  In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings  which will provide some relief  if they sold at peaks  this would provide $700 million in cash  Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts   **No need for new factories if you fire 15 20k workers**   Well  everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https:\/\/fortune com\/asia\/2024\/03\/22\/tesla cut ev production china plant amid sluggish sales growth intense competition worlds biggest car market\/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide  In 12 months I counted 12 13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https:\/\/twitter com\/EdwardDiGi\/status\/1778066496075223507)  Still  Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies  &#x200B;

its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https:\/\/  &#x200B;  **New narrative: cars do not matter anymore  Elon is in warmode  but will the robotaxi save everyone  **   These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years  in terms of unit cars:  * 2024 1'950'000 * 2025 2'280'000 * 2026 2'750'000 * 2027 3'340'000 * 2028 4'150'000  As you can see  huge growth will happen in 2026  but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today  how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues     First of all  Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https:\/\/ while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators  Tesla is not a pioneer  is actually late  Secondly  how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup  analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that  whats next   Thirdly  lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi  Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity  Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales    Fourth  given the complexity of the topic  I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies  not private ones    In conclusion  not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales  but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong    **Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive  plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**  Despite its huge net cash balance  Tesla issued debt several times last year:  * [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https:\/\/ * [$1 8 billion ABS September 2023](https:\/\/asreport americanbanker com\/news\/tesla prepares to issue 1 2 billion in electric vehicle secured notes) * [$0 75 billion December 2023](https:\/\/  This is very weird  and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023  being replaced by the Chief of Accounting   According to some estimates  also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings  The delta became smaller over time  but still noticeable  https:\/\/preview redd it\/9z1ituyxc0vc1 png width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2  Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter  collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet  Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter  probably they cannot do this any more   **CONCLUSIONS**  I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER  Although the cancellation of M2  negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest  Regardless  this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations  $10 15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount   Morgan Stanley expects $1 12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla  which is a 160x PE forward   that is crazy if compared to the 30 35x of NVDA  The street is still at $2 5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;

($F) possible 20x bagger coming up \ud83e\udd11 4\/24 Hello Regards  Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick   because it ain\u2019t no fun if the homies can\u2019t have none   **The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company  makers of EV\u2019s  Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th    Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry  The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12   Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them  supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines  Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150)  Additionally Ford is America\u2019s #2 EV seller  They have a full lineup of vehicles  and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth   But here\u2019s the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE  Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE  With the transition from ICE to EV  this is very much a growth stock now  with **shitfucktons** of room to go  That\u2019s a lot   Ford\u2019s F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1  this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023  And this isn\u2019t even factoring in the 500k cars and 6 8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined   **Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here:   https:\/\/youtu be\/ayWtbehZ8zg si=Z 75W7Fd7MNxiVqb  **Main bullet points that got me in:**  *The Jan 2022 price was $25 87  Currently the price is $12 14  That\u2019s a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that\u2019s likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day    *Short Float only 3

People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT  and not have to wait 3 years to get it  To me this is the strongest case  It\u2019s like Meta\u2019s Quest 3 vs Apple\u2019s Vision Pro  Meta rode the coat tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023  by providing the non hype version of a product that does the same shit  and even does some shit better   *Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards  And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded  Currently $14 5 $15+ calls on 4\/26 are $0 01 asks  If you look at the options chain  a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain  A $3 move means your wife\u2019s boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is  You can buy him a Cybertruck that he\u2019ll get sometime in 2028   *Huge Call OI   almost 65%  Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab  *55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond

safety net and familiar  Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don\u2019t matter and we\u2019re all dead  a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts  Ford is not immune  but better off for sure   **Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12 82c and 30k $13 82c expiring on 4\/19  That\u2019s a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes  almost like somebody knows something \ud83e\uddd0  **Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above  it\u2019s possible Ford may announce a stock buy back before or on the earnings call  which will raise the share price  So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don\u2019t hit by Friday  Perhaps that was their plan  The $12 82 looks good though IMO  I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there\u2019s no WW3 market panic  which seems to be fading rn    Conclusion:  Solid Automaker that\u2019s not going anywhere  Risk reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat  Boomer Divi stock that\u2019s also now a growth stock    My Positions:  $14 5c x100   4\/26 $15 5c x26   4\/26 $15c x150   4\/26 $13 5c x23   5\/3   Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)  Good luck

electric vehicles  owns R&D centers  and operates battery swapping as a service centers in Norway  Sweden  the Netherlands  Denmark  Spain  Germany  the U K   People's Republic of China  Hong Kong  Thailand  and pending status for the U S A  (through Puerto Rico or Mexico)  The company offers five  six  and seven seater electric SUVs  It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing  design  and technology development activities; manufacture of e powertrains  battery packs  and components; and sales and after sales management activities  In addition  the company offers charging solutions  including Power Home  a home charging solution; Power Swap  a battery swapping service; Power Mobile  a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger  a public fast charging solution; and Power Express  a 24 hour on demand pick up and drop off charging service  Further  it provides value added services  such as statutory and third party liability insurance  and vehicle damage insurance through third party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance  as well as data packages  NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N V  for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8  a six or seven seater high performance electric SUV   So to summarize:  * Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars * Offers a multitude of charging solutions * Offers BaaS in the European Union  mainland Chyna  and Southeast Asia (Battery as a subscription service  meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later) * Provides vehicle damage insurance  statutory and third party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own) * Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance  and data packages  Now that's a handful and we don't have all day  so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS  This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment  it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things   Market and Competition  Market  Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future  but it's worth mentioning regardless   The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%  and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030  By 2026  worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD  or $500 Billion  (Also  for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is  it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%  Not overall  but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur ) What's more  is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth  Here's a graph that represents these projections   If we take a more specific look to NIO's market  analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts  now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025  Beyond that  the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration  respectively   Strategy  The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board  so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model  Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent  stable order flow  rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla  (Courtesy of J P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady  Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise   We could also discuss their consumer relationship  and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out \u00a0Apparently\u00a0Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla  but I don't have the experience to confirm that  Regardless  between their own app for owners  special owner events  and communal spaces  it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base   BaaS  Battery as a Service  Or rather  a subscription  Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non traditional manner  electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs  This shaves off roughly $10 000 off the price of their vehicles  which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand  Also  BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit  Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far  and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers  This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale  You may be thinking  does this benefit the consumer in anyway  Sure it does  The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs  Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily  Also  consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution  downgrade  Going on a large roadtrip  No problem  just rent a larger battery size  However  the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation  Instead of being stuck with a dated or low end battery  all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery  What does this mean  Well  basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute  Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack  and one size fits all  This improves resale value  and provides a future proof battery system  Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later)  but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro consumer  improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic)  and offers Nio Inc  another revenue stream  To recap: Extra revenue stream  easy to scale  brand visibility  and very pro consumer   Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the European Union and Chinese governments both favor BaaS companies when it comes to benefits  so there's that too   Catalysts  I don't actually have a lot of research in this area  so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in   * European Union and North American Market Expansion * Rapid Clean Tech Movement * New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors * NIO's recent partnership with CATL and Chyna's largest automakers to produce solid state EV batteries with a longer life * Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road  This is pure speculation  but there are claims that Nio Inc  has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U S  Market  through setting up off shore factories in Puerto Rico or Mexico by 2030   Local environment  Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure  As previously mentioned  they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service  or BaaS for short  Now  we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice  but how well are they executing  As of right now  NIO currently has roughly 243 battery changing stations in China  and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more  Additionally  they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations   This all sounds great  right  We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established  There is of course  a predictable drawback that I should mention  Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way  other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into  because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio power network that allows for battery swapping  Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets  because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas  Anyway  let's move on   Now as you probably know  NIO is a China based EV company  Why is that a good thing exactly  Well  here's why  The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug in hybrids or battery powered electric vehicles (EVs)  China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025  On top of that  China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world  and even further  they're the largest investor in renewable energies  OK  IDGAF where's the relation to cars  It's not super concrete  but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy  They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy  so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible  Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals  and how large the Chinese EV market is\/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow  Actually  let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts   * China is the\u00a0largest\u00a0EV market in the world  representing roughly\u00a050%\u00a0of worldwide sales   Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market  we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability   Financials and Numbers  Not gonna do much talking here  just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will   Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook  \u2022 Vehicle sales\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB15 438 7 million (US$2 174 5 million)  representing an increase of 4 6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 11 3% from the third quarter of 2023  The increase in vehicle sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in delivery volume  partially offset by the lower average selling price as a result of changes in product mix  The decrease in vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2023 was mainly attributed to a decrease in delivery volume   \u2022 Vehicle sales\u00a0for the full year of 2023 were RMB49 257 3 million (US$6 937 7 million)  representing an increase of 8 2% from the previous year   \u2022 Other sales\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB1 664 5 million (US$234 4 million)  representing an increase of 27 6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and an increase of 0 4% from the third quarter of 2023  The increase in other sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in sales of accessories and provision of power solutions  as a result of continued growth in the number of our users  Other sales remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023   \u2022 Other sales\u00a0for the full year of 2023 were RMB6 360 7 million (US$895 9 million)  representing an increase of 69 1% from the previous year   Investment Outlook  Analyst Consensus  Need a third opinion  This is one of the\u00a0biggest green flags\u00a0IMO  These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is  Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks  Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 3 10 (As of April 16th)  Price targets:  * HSBC: $9 * Morgan Stanley: $8 * J P  Morgan: $7 * Deutsche: $7 * Bank of America: $7 * Goldman Sachs: $6 * Mizuho Securities: $10  Conclusion  Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic  especially the European Union market  but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach  Feel free to debate me on that  I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management  seen a lot of fans of\u00a0William Li  calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'  There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition  their other services\/packages  and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles  but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others    \u00a0Good growth opportunity (E U  and N A )  * Good market (Local environment too) * Good strategic approach * The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits * Huge dip (50% at one point)","Ticker_Symbol":"NIO","Hist_Price":3.8099999428,"Curr_Price":4.1402001381,"Stock_Growth":0.0866667192,"Post_Date":1713304017.0,"Curr_Date":1714073383.5193328857,"Label":1},{"Post_ID":"1c5qqxy","Text":"Let\u2019s

to the stratosphere A weak DD So here is the thing  I\u2019ve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto  and it made me realize 2 things   1  After the bitcoin halving  which btw is meant to be on 4\/20  the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold  This  for the highly regarded  means it\u2019s going to be RARE    Rarity = scarcity When something is scarce = demand  demand = price go up ( big green )  2  Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph) For us regards  this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas  Not by human hands  These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period   The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number )  In the case of bitcoin and  this model  that number is  953  which means that it is 95 3% accurate  To add to this  the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far\u2026 out of any asset that has had power law applied to it    So why ramble about all this on here  and how does this relate to coinbase  Well if you look at the graph  we are very likely to expect a price of 150 200k in a years time and a million in about 10  The reason I don\u2019t believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin  It\u2019s here to stay    Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide  second to Binance globally and 1st in the US  When it comes to users  it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million  however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users  With this information  imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere  The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it  convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings   Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run  all through coinbase with its user friendly interface  Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto  and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools  https:\/\/  To conclude  This is quite a long term play  Considering the  20% drop over the past couple days  and the halving coming up by the end of this week  it may be a good time to jump in    I\u2019m full porting this one  Best of luck my fellow regards  May your accounts be green and lambo\u2019s in

of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share  What has changed you may ask   The sell off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :  1  Early 2019  VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans  now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio  Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line  2  Dec 2020  they did a $2 1 billion debt financed acquisition of Supreme  which has since resulted in approximately 800 900 million in impairment cost  and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands  3  Over ordering of inventories during COVID 19  resulting in the need to sell their Vans\/Timberland\/Dickies inventory at a discount  4  Throughout 2022 to late 2023  Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year over year in 2022 and a further 22% year over year in 2023  resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales  5  March 17 2022  FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation  Borrowing costs increased from 0 25% in March 2022 to 5 25% in July 2023  This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price  6  In Dec 2022  Steve Rendle  the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales  Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place  7  After 7 months  in July 2023  a new CEO  Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO)  was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands  but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance  cut the dividend yield from 4 6% ish  to 0 9%  and declared multiple asset write down  This further crashed the stock price  while the company announced the \"Reinvent\" program  a 4 year plan to bolster growth  8  As of October 2023  VFC had become a debt ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance  making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations  The US 10 Year Yield at that time hit a 52 week high of 5% in October 2023  and the stock slid to $13 ( 87% from ATH)  9  In April 2024  VFC was dropped from all S&P 500 related indices and the FTSE All World Index due to its market cap falling into the small cap category  further contributing to the slide in the share price  10  On April 11  2024  the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected  pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates  and VFC's stock slid to a 15 year low of $12 per share  last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis      ## The Turnaround Opportunity  Despite the deteriorating sales  I believe the bottom is near  and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround    Here's why:  ## New CEO: Bracken Darrell  Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience  He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years  during which time the share price increased tenfold  At Logitech  he strategically positioned the company into different markets  such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration\/live streaming tools  and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series  The tiny gaming business of Logitech  which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left  Logitech MX series was founded during his tenure Before Logitech  Darrell was at Procter & Gamble  tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic  which he successfully did  Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth  This time is no different   ## VF Corp's 5 Point Turnaround Plan: \"Reinvent\"   VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called \"Reinvent\" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton  Here are the core issues to be addressed :  1  **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose  target audience  product plan  and marketing approach  and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024  2  **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform  similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region  to improve results over time  3  **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority  VFC at one point racked up 6 5 billion in debt  In the most recent quarter  VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend  They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing  4  **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right sizing the company's structure  selling real estate assets in Switzerland  and addressing other non strategic areas  5  **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non core brands  such as Kipling  Eastpak  and Jansport  that do not align with their long term ambitions  to raise cash and pay down debt  VF Corp has 13 brands  and there may be other brands which will be sold   ## Recent Positive Developments  * Activist investors  such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management  own a significant stake in VF Corp  indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential  * VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million  which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround  You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments  * VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia  North Africa  the United Arab Emirates  and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years  does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode   * In their most recent quarter  the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle  achieving positive changes in accounts receivable   ## Comparative Valuation Analysis  The North Face (TNF) brand  which is one of VFC's brands  alone generates $3 6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow      In comparison  Crocs  a footwear company with only two brands  generates $3 9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7 5 billion      VF Corp  with 13 brands  of which The North Face alone generates $3 6 billion in revenue  is trading at a market capitalization of only $4 7 billion  How is this $2 8 billion difference justified    Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity  This gives a share price of $21 00   [https:\/\/docs google com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX

an average 15x P\/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap  Which is a 3x upside from here   I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years  My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall  is $62  but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did  In that likely scenario  price target is >$100  but it's too far down the line to know as of now       Hope you guys enjoyed this DD  took me months to get everything sourced and organized   Will make more of

he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument   FIRST   Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price    \"But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares \" > at the discretion of the issuer  \"But never agree to low price \/ it's fraud \" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer  He could even choose a

  Two Ways to Play in 2024 There are a couple of DD's out there already around PAA (\"Drill Baby Drill  Possible 25 Baggers\" AND \"PAA   Why it can go high  even if oil doesn't\") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26  I bought $20C 8\/16 and made a quick 330% profit  but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb  I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year  however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4  That's why I think there are two ways this should be played  My current positions are listed at the end of this thread   Midstream companies benefit when production is high  They have contracts in place with upstream companies  but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down  BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract \u00a0Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2 \u00a0  **Frac Spread**  What is it  Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US  It's a leading indicator of oil production  Midstream companies  like PAA  thrive when production is high There was an increase in fracture spread in February  but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year\/Year)  2024 compared to same time 2023  The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year  Production is way down compared to this time of year  Same with Rig Counts (see below)\u00a0Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year  same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023 \u00a0   &#x200B;  https:\/\/preview redd it\/nzczrcdv1ouc1 png width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dc206826bda2ea0e001b9281b211dda5a2093dc  **Rig Count**   What is it  Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada  Again  just like Frac Spread  there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024    https:\/\/preview redd it\/yqwfn8vw1ouc1 png width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=33519546acc2b3fb95dd24b44a8c0f3101b09b42  [https:\/\/  Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2  they were relatively low in Q1  Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high    https:\/\/preview redd it\/12vr3cky1ouc1 png width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b90b053824d847e62fab1a25808a378eda3fcd6  Again  I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year  but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2  Keep an eye on frac spread  rig count  and oil prices  If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year  but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction  AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread  rig count  and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price  I'm just not there yet   I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction  Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price  \u00a0This is not financial advice \u00a0Just

DD   Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably  While its competitors   AMD and NVIDA   have hit the moon and then some  Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was  If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype  they'd have been wrong to choose Intel  Problematic   There are reasons for this  of course  Intel has not come out with a cutting edge product   Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water  Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure  Intel has been  since way before this subreddit existed  known for being a limp stock that trading sideways  China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips  All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI   and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it   became clear   In spite of all this  I think Intel is a strong buy right now  Why   For one  it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year  There's been a string of bad   but not structurally undermining   news coming out about the company recently  similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago  Google is now at 160  because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column  The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up  If you want that in technical analytic terms   RSI is below 30  Buy   Intel is also catching up  [It's releasing a chip](https:\/\/finance yahoo com\/news\/intels artificial intelligence ai chip 085500073 html) that can beat the H100  That's not the whole story  of course   there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year  But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking  We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level  which requires a lot of hardware  Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance   people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting edge chips for a long  long time  And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap    There's also the national security angle  Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker  and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries  Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts  and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash    Their earnings call is on 4\/25  and so [here's my 4\/26 call

America got a bunch of immigrants recently too from what I hear  so they got to shop somewhere    Walmart has a great supply chain and has been resilient in many the ways America wishes it would have stayed given the current era of \"Friend Shoring\"   Not to be political  but to essentially point out that there's government support for this type of business resilience due to the erosion of globalization sourced dependencies    Walmart will release it's earnings on May 19th  and while there  Given the back tick in CBOE VIX Volatility  I anticipate some bag holders cashing out a portion of their earnings  Rightfully so  but if you want to keep those assets appreciating  albeit less risky and slower over the next months till you see the next roller coaster you want to ride   consider

Reactions to Tesla Robo Taxis **Recap of What Happened:**\u00a0  Elon Musk\u2019s latest claim on Twitter was to announce the long awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th  shooting the stock market up

again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi \u00a0  Elon Musk was quoted responding on X  saying that Reuters was \u201clying (again) \u201d even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company   **Sides Are Split **  Although Tesla's stock shot up  from what I can tell WSB has had very different reactions to the announcement:  **Bull Viewpoint:**  If the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed  some believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla\u2019s current position in the market  If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi  then many analysts see this as a major positive   Tesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one  and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true  The actual vehicle has never been Tesla\u2019s main asset  but its self driving robotaxi network  which is just now coming fully into focus  is its main value driver  Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product  which would give Tesla very favorable economics   **Bear Viewpoint:**  On the other side  many believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business  labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company  metrics that have really suffered in 2025 \u00a0  In order for features such as FSD  or full self driving  to be as accurate as possible  Tesla needs more data  To get more data  the EV maker needs

is ridiculously cheap fundamentally   I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2 3x the current price   Market cap is just 200 mil     They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023  Are you kidding me   Fundamental thesis:    Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024  This shift towards a more service oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty     Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years  For example  from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020  to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years  although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023  Despite this  GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023     Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U S  camcorder market  with the HERO12 BLACK being the best selling camera  The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel  indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition     Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite  aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets  starting with motorcycle helmets  signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments  leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts     Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services  with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services  The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty  with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year     Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement  diversity  and sustainability goals  The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U S  locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions     Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years  but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive  indicating a healthy operational profit margin  There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix  with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019   Analyzing these points  GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services  its strong brand presence  and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth  While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023  GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience  Given this context  a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative  especially when considering the company's assets  equity  and strategic positioning for future growth  The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence  which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic

my reasoning:  * In the lead up to WWDC  I expect AAPL to trade more on news and speculation rather than fundamental business factors  For instance  reports of lackluster iPhone shipments in China are likely to disappoint investors again  potentially driving the stock price back down towards $168 or even lower  * I also anticipate some profit taking from investors who were waiting for this recent price increase to sell their shares   While I believe the long term fundamentals for Apple remain strong  and the stock will move significantly higher over the course of the year  I felt a 4% gain was a good enough opportunity to cash out for now  Investors who maintained a long position have little to worry about  but I think the stock may tread water a bit further before resuming its upward climb

trouble and needs a bailout   **Current Situation**  Paramount Global entered exclusive talks with Skydance and are working on a 2 step deal:  1  Skydance bails out National Amusements with a $2 Billion cash payment 2  Paramount Global acquires Skydance giving Skydance $5 Billion in equity  thus dilluting current shareholders by about 50%   The deal must be passed through a special committee with fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders  However  4 members stepped down  Those 4 members are rumored to be against the merger   Shari Redstone is doing all she can to save her holding company National Amusement while screwing over all the other shareholders    almost exactly how she forced the merger of ViacomCBS   Multiple Common Shareholders have begun threatening lawsuits

after  I also think the value of that Netflix deal can give them a stronger forecast   Playing this through earnings only so I\u2019ve grabbed May 17 105C  I\u2019m still regarded and don\u2019t know how I can include more than one picture  55 contracts at average cost of 1 81  $9937 23 total on the line    Good luck to anyone currently holding or thinking of jumping in  And if you have reasons why they won\u2019t continue to rise please share your thoughts as maybe I\u2019ve missed some important

Mining   Bullish channel break after bad event **Here's a quick rundown about SSRM:**  * Current  market cap is 25% of fair value of assets  Current cash is 44% of cap  * Owns  and operates mines in Nevada (Marigold)  Saskatchewan (Seabee)  and      Argentina (Pirquitas) * Formerly known as Silver Standard Resources * Recently faced a landslide at their \u00c7\u00f6pler mine in Turkey  suspending operations      and facing investigations    * Turkey is still a 2nd tier economy  They need mining companies for their economic stability and these companies are deeply tied to the political class * Currently  under a class action lawsuit regarding potential securities fraud  **The negative event has created a tremendous discount in the share price of  SSRM**  **SSR Mining made $1 43 billion in revenue** for the twelve months ending December 31  2023  This showed a significant increase of 24 29% compared to their revenue in the previous year   * **Gold:** Prices rose in 2023  with estimates suggesting an average of around $1 800 per ounce  Currently  gold is trading at around $2 344 per ounce * **Silver:** Silver averaged $23 per ounce in 2023  Silver is at $28 per ounce * **Copper:** Copper prices might have averaged around $4 50 per pound in 2023  Copper is currently at $4 29 per pound  **SSR Mining promises at  07\/quarter in divi**s plus continued share buy backs  Last year they purchased under 1 million shares so the impact of that is minimal  **This year with a suppressed stock price it will be over 1 million and have more of an impact on EPS **  **Technicals:**  After a full quarter of consolidation  the stock broke the upper end of the channel  It is currently trading in the zone north of $4 73  where it saw little volume trade on its mega drop after the news about the \u00c7\u00f6pler mine  Especially when the price is north of $5 63  it will have nowhere to go but up because all the pain baked in will be gone   **Given the consistent rally in metals  the tendency for gold to be a safe haven  and the likely outcome of the company's next two quarters I am extremely bullish on the price from here **  Most likely is it climbs into the lower end of the previous channel \\~$9 with enough time  Less likely events would be a reversion to the prior channel and\/or some kind of transaction that jolts the price   **Position: Shares for a long term hold  calls for a short term hold (60) days
